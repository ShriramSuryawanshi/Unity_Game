This is the android/iOS game built using Unity. I have used the free sprite assets provided by unity to create background and game platform, as well sprite characters to create different animations.
The game is not complete yet, as of now I have completed the below functionalities and animations -

Game Player - Idle, Walk, Run, Jump, Collecting Diamonds, Sword Swings, Killing Enemies

Enemies  - Spider, Hulk, Skeleton - for each enemy implemented animations  - Idle, Walk, Attack on Player, Death

Future Implementations -

3. Create more objects of above three Enemy classes, and have more enemies
4. Sound Effects
